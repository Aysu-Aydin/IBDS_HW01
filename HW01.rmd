### **Why Molecular Biology is Cool?**

*  ***Origin of Life:*** Molecular biology sheds light on our journey to discover the origin of life by examining the basic building blocks of living organisms at the molecular level.

*  ***Multi-disciplinarity:*** I like the many fields you get to study physics, bioinformatics, organic chemistry, cell biology, math, thermodynamics, physiology, immunology, even quantum biology. It's like getting a taste of almost everything, which means there's always something new to learn for curious minds.
